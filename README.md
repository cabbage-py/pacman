# pacman
A code challenge for IE Digital

Code Assumptions:
 - Commands are to be given in a readable text filename
 - Pacman is on a 5 x 5 grid, from index 0-4 on the x and y axis
 - The REPORT command will end the code.

Brief explanation behind the code:
 - This program is coded in an OOP style, to make it easy to add additional features.
 - This program could easily be made with lots of if-else statements, but that would make it unreadable.
 - I tried to make it as readable, with as little if-else statements as possible.

 - The only print statements include: Asking for the filename, and Outputting the result.
 - No other print statements are included. (but that can be easily changed)

 - This code will ignore unreadable files and incorrect commands (i.e. wrong spelling, wrong arguments)
